This directory contains two programs and some sample input files for project 1.

For the input files, I used the convention that no file suffix (e.g., in3x3) is
an ascii file, while the .bin suffix (e.g., in3x3.bin) is a binary file.  You
can create more input (ascii) files by hand using your favorite editor, and then
use program a2b to convert them into the binary format required by proj1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program a2b.c can be used to convert matrices or vectors stored as human-readable
(ascii) files into binary files.  For example, in this directory, the binary file
in3x3.bin was created by running:

  ./a2b in3x3 in3x3.bin

Note that a2b can be used to generate vectors (e.g., permutation vectors) by giving
it "m x 1" matrices.  If the number of columns is 1, a2b assumes you want to write
a binary file containing a vector rather than a matrix.  The only difference is
that a matrix file begins with m and n, the number of rows and columns; a vector
file begins with only m, the number of entries in the vector.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program proj1.c is a shell that you are welcome to start with in writing your
solution to project 1.  Right now, all it does is read in a matrix and a vector
and print them back out.

You can run it as follows:

  mpirun -np 1 ./proj1 in3x4.bin in3x1.in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the Makefile for how to compile and link both a2b.c and proj1.c.
